Instead of installing it via the substantially large XCode software, we suggest a different method that won’t take up around 35 GB of your disk space.\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nOpen the Terminal application. It’s typically located in the /Applications/Utilities folder. Alternatively, press ⌘ and space bar simultaneously, type “terminal” in the search box, and select the Terminal application.\nOnce you see a prompt in the Terminal application, type xcode-select --install and hit Enter.\nFollow the instructions for installation when you’re prompted. Be aware it might take a few minutes to finish installing.\nClick here, skip the first step, and follow step 2 to 14.\n\nBy the end you should have created your first repository.\n\n\nFor Windows Users: Installing Git and Chrome or Firefox\nWe’ll be utilizing JupyterLab and/or VS Code in this tutorial. As JupyterLab is a browser-based application, it’s compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. However, Microsoft Edge isn’t supported. So, if you’re a Windows user, make sure you have either Chrome or Firefox installed.\nYou’ll also need to install Git.

    "text": "Introduction to Anaconda and Virtual Environments\nAnaconda is an open-source distribution that simplifies package management and deployment for both Python and R. Particularly popular among data scientists and machine learning engineers, Anaconda is equipped a multitude of tools for data science, scientific computing, and much more.\nWhy should you use Anaconda?\nOne of the main reasons is its package manager called Conda. With Conda, not only can you easily install packages, but you can also set up isolated environments to keep your projects organized and prevent potential conflicts between package versions.\nHere’s how to download Anaconda:\n\nNavigate to Anaconda’s download page.\nChoose your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\nSelect the Python 3.x version and click Download.\nRun the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.\n\nNow, let’s talk about virtual environments.\nVirtual environments are isolated environments where you can install packages and run code without affecting the rest of your system. These environments help you manage your project-specific dependencies separately, thus avoiding versioning conflicts and maintaining stability across all your projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nEach project should ideally have its own virtual environment.\n\n\n\nCreating your first Conda environment\nTo create a virtual environment using Conda, you can follow these steps:\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt.\nEnter conda create --name myenv python=3.10 replacing ‘myenv’ with the name you want to assign to your new environment. Note that we directly installed python (version 3.10).\nActivate your new environment by typing conda activate myenv (again, replace ‘myenv’ with the name of your environment).\nYou can now install packages either through conda install package_name or also using pip install package_name in the activated environment.\n\nNow, any packages that you install while this environment is activated will only affect this particular environment, leaving your global environment and any other virtual environments unchanged.\nBy using Anaconda and taking advantage of virtual environments, you can create a more organized, conflict-free coding setup, making your data science or programming projects significantly smoother and more manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Create course conda environment\n\n\n\n\nUse the commands above to create an environment with the name ch200 with python=3.10.\nActivate the created environment.\nAnd install the package jupyter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Create course conda environment\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the command line tool:\nconda create --name ch200 python=3.10\nconda activate ch200\nconda install jupyter"

    "section": "Introduction to IDEs and Text Editors",
    "text": "Introduction to IDEs and Text Editors\nAn important component of any programming or coding project is the tool used to write and edit your code. Two of the main options that we will be working with in this course are JupyterLab and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).\n\nJupyterLab\nJupyterLab is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Jupyter Notebooks, a project of the Project Jupyter open-source project. JupyterLab is web-based and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Jupyter notebooks, code editors, data file viewers, terminals, and more, making it a great tool for data science projects.\n\n\nVisual Studio Code (VS Code)\nVisual Studio Code, often just called VS Code, is a popular free source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, code refactoring, and more. Its features are highly extendable through plugins, and it supports a multitude of programming languages.\n\n\nDifferences between JupyterLab and VS Code\nWhile both JupyterLab and VS Code are powerful tools, there are key differences between the two:\n\nEnvironment: JupyterLab provides a web-based interface and is ideal for interactive and exploratory computing. On the other hand, VS Code is a comprehensive text editor and is more akin to a full-fledged integrated development environment.\nUse Case: JupyterLab excels when working with Jupyter notebooks and tasks that require visualizing data, running data analysis, and scientific computing in Python, Julia, R and other similar languages. VS Code shines when developing applications in various programming languages and it’s great for writing and managing codebases.\nFeatures: JupyterLab primarily offers an intuitive interface for running and editing Jupyter notebooks, viewing plots, and inspecting file variables. VS Code offers debugging tools, has Git commands built-in, can be customized and extended with plugins, and supports a multitude of programming languages.\n\nDepending on your project, you could find one tool to be more efficient than the other. JupyterLab’s interactive workflow could be beneficial for tasks such as data exploration and visualization, whereas VS Code might be more suited to application development. Ultimately, both are extremely useful and offer unique capabilities that could help improve your programming workflow."

This should start the JupyterLab application and open a new tab in your default web browser displaying the JupyterLab interface.\n\nOnce in the interface, you can create a new notebook by clicking on the Python 3 icon in the Launcher, or by going to File -&gt; New -&gt; Notebook."

For this setup, we are particularly interested in the Python extension, which includes rich support for the Python language, and the Jupyter Notebook extension, which allows you to create and run Jupyter notebooks within VS Code.\nHere’s how to install these extensions:\n\nOpen VS Code.\nClick on the Extensions view icon on the Sidebar located on the left-hand side, or, alternatively, use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X.\nIn the Extensions view search bar, type Python and look for the extension named Python developed by Microsoft. Click Install to add this extension.\nAfter installing the Python extension, search for Jupyter in the Extensions view search bar. Look for the Jupyter extension also developed by Microsoft. Click Install to add it.\n\nWith those two extensions installed, you can now create or open .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) files and use VS Code to develop Python applications. When you open a .ipynb file, VS Code will enter the notebook editor mode where you can create and run Jupyter notebook cells.\nTo create a new Jupyter notebook in VS Code:\n\nGo to File -&gt; New File.\nFrom the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type Python: Select Interpreter to select your previously created Conda or Python environment.\nBack in the command palette, type Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook, an .ipynb file is created and you can start writing your Python code in cells.\n\nFinally, remember that VS Code also comes with a lot built-in features for coding, but might be a bit harder to handle for beginners."
