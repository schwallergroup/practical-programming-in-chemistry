    "text": "Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that carry out a specific task. When working on larger scale projects, functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\nPython has many built-in functions like print(), input(), len(), etc, but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined functions.\n\n\nYou can define your own function in Python using the keyword def.\nHere’s a simple example of a function that calculates the square of a number:\ndef square(number):\n    sq = number ** 2\n    return sq\nIn this code, square is the function name, number is the input parameter to the function, the operator ** is used to calculate the square of a number and return is the keyword used to output a value from the function.\n\n\n\nTo call a function, you simply need to provide the function name followed by parentheses with required parameters, if any.\nprint(square(6)) #Output: 36\n\n\n\nYou can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can accept any number and type of parameters.\nLet’s create a function that greet a user:\ndef greet(name):\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \". Good Morning!\")\nNow we can call this function and pass a name as the argument:\ngreet('Alice') #Output: Hello, Alice. Good Morning!\n\n\n\nYou can set a default parameter value for a function. If we call the function without argument, it uses the default value.\ndef greet(name = \"User\"):\n    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \". Good Morning!\") \n\ngreet() #Output: Hello, User. Good Morning!\nIn the context of chemistry, we can wrap a series of calculations within a function. For example, a chemist may often need to calculate the molar mass for different substances. This can be done using a function:\n# Function to calculate molar mass of hydrocarbons\ndef calculate_molar_mass(hydrogen, carbon):\n    H = 1.008  # molar mass of Hydrogen\n    C = 12.01  # molar mass of Carbon\n    return (H*hydrogen + C*carbon)\n\n# Now calculate molar mass of Methane (CH4)\nprint(calculate_molar_mass(4, 1))  #Output: 16.042\nThis way, chemists can create their own library of useful functions to perform various calculations related to their work, increasing efficiency and reducing the chance of errors in their calculations.\n\n\nLet’s go through more examples of functions, this time keeping our examples more chemistry oriented.\n\n\nSay you routinely need to calculate the number of moles in a sample given its mass and molar mass. We can make a function to do exactly this:\n# Function to calculate amount of substance\ndef calculate_moles(mass, molar_mass):\n    return mass / molar_mass\n\n# Now calculate the moles in a 22g sample of Carbon (C = 12.01 g/mol)\nprint(calculate_moles(22, 12.01)) \n\n\n\nIf you often perform dilutions, you might want a function to quickly calculate the final concentration after dilution:\n# Function to calculate final concentration after dilution\ndef dilute(C1, V1, V2):\n    return (C1 * V1) / V2\n\n# Now calculate the concentration after dilution\nprint(dilute(0.5, 5, 10))  \n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a function to calculate the pH of a solution given the concentration of H+ ions.\nWrite a function that returns the concentration of OH- ions given the concentration of H+ ions.\nWrite a function to calculate the final pressure of a gas given initial pressure, volume and temperature, and final volume and temperature (use ideal gas law).\nWrite a function that calculates and returns the molar mass of a hydrocarbon given numbers of H, C and O atoms.\nWrite a function that calculates mass percent of an element in a compound given the molar mass of the element and the compound.\n\n\n\n\nSolution 1:\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_pH(H_concentration):\n    return -math.log10(H_concentration)\n\nprint(calculate_pH(0.0001))  \nSolution 2:\ndef calculate_OH_concentration(H_concentration):\n    Kw = 1.0e-14\n    return Kw / H_concentration\n\nprint(calculate_pH(0.0001))   \nSolution 3:\ndef calculate_final_pressure(P1, V1, T1, V2, T2):\n    return (P1 * V1 / T1) * (T2 / V2)\n\nprint(calculate_final_pressure(2, 10, 300, 5, 300))  \nSolution 4:\ndef calculate_molar_mass(hydrogen, carbon, oxygen):\n    H = 1.008  \n    C = 12.01 \n    O = 16.00 \n    return (H*hydrogen + C*carbon + O*oxygen)\n\nprint(calculate_molar_mass(4, 2, 2)) \nSolution 5:\ndef calculate_mass_percent(element_molar_mass, compound_molar_mass):\n    return (element_molar_mass / compound_molar_mass) * 100\n\nprint(calculate_mass_percent(12.01, 18.015)) \nThat’s it!

Python is widely used in all fields of science, including Chemistry, due to its simplicity and flexibility. Specifically, we will focus on the concept of variables and types, then comparison and conditional operators.\n\n\nA large part of programming involves manipulating variables - containers that hold data. A variable can be of different types - integer, float, string, among others. Python automatically assigns a variable the type that is appropriate for its value.\n\n\nAn Integer variable holds integer values. In Python, you don’t have to specify the type of a variable when you create it. When you assign an integer value to a variable, Python knows that the variable is an integer.\nLet’s see an example:\natom_count = 6\nprint(atom_count)\nprint(type(atom_count))\nThis will output:\n6\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\nIn chemistry, there are many times when we use integers. For example, number of moles, number of atoms etc.\n\n\n\nFloat stands for ‘floating point number’. You can use it for rational numbers, usually ending with a decimal figure, such as 1.11 or 3.14.\natomic_weight_carbon = 12.01\nprint(atomic_weight_carbon)\nprint(type(atomic_weight_carbon))\nThis will output:\n12.01\n&lt;class 'float'&gt;\nIn chemistry, atomic weights, concentration values etc are commonly represented as floating point numbers.\n\n\n\nIn Python, String variables are used to store textual data, a sequence of characters.\nelement_name = \"Carbon\"\nprint(element_name)\nprint(type(element_name))\nThis will output:\nCarbon\n&lt;class 'str'&gt;\nIn chemistry, we often deal with strings when handling names of compounds, elements etc.\n\n\n\nNow that we have learned about Variables and Types in Python, let’s test your understanding with the following exercises:\n\nCreate an integer variable named molecule_count and assign it a value of 20. Print its value and type.\nCreate a float variable named molar_mass_oxygen and assign it a value of 16.00. Print its value and type.\nCreate a string variable named chemical_formula_water and assign it a value of “H2O”. Print its value and type.\nChange the value of molecule_count to 50.

    "section": "(Advanced) Understanding GitHub Forks",
    "text": "(Advanced) Understanding GitHub Forks\nA ‘fork’ is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository in GitHub allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. It is an essential part of open-source contribution workflows and it’s how users can propose changes to projects that they do not have write access to.\nHere’s how it typically works:\n\nYou find a project on GitHub that you’d like to contribute to or experiment with, so you ‘fork’ it. This creates a copy of the project in your own GitHub account.\nYou clone the forked repository down to your local machine with git clone for further experimentation.\nIn your local copy, you can make changes, try out new ideas, or fix bugs—often in a separate branch.\nOnce you’re satisfied with your changes, you can commit them to your forked repository and push them to your GitHub account with git push.\nIf the changes you’ve made to your fork would be useful to the original repository, you can open a ‘pull request’. This lets the original repository’s maintainer see your changes and, if they approve, merge them into the original repository.\n\nWhy are forks useful?\nForks are a way of showcasing your modifications to the original project without directly changing it. It allows you to make changes to a project without affecting the work of others. You’re able to freely experiment within your fork, and once you have something worthwhile, you can share it back with the original repository.\nMoreover, forks are also useful in open-source contribution, where you can propose changes to an open-source project. If the project maintainers like your contribution, they can merge your fork, making your changes a part of the official project!\nUnderstanding and being able to work with forks can increase your collaboration options and open doors to contributing to open-source projects."

    "section": "(Advanced) Introduction to Pull Requests",
    "text": "(Advanced) Introduction to Pull Requests\nIn the world of collaborative coding, a pull request is a key way of contributing to the shared or open source projects. It’s a method used to submit contributions to an existing Git project.\nA pull request, sometimes referred to as a PR, is a request for the repository’s maintainers to review your work, provide feedback, and if it is up to the project’s standards, merge your contributions into the project.\nLet’s break down the basic steps of creating a pull request:\n\nFork and Clone the Repository: You start by making a copy (fork) of the repository you wish to contribute to. Then, you clone this repository to your local machine.\nCreate a New Branch: Next, you create a new branch in your local repository. By making changes in a separate branch (other than main), you avoid potential conflicts with the main branch or other contributors’ work.\nMake Changes: Now you can make changes in your new branch. This could be adding a feature, fixing a bug, improving documentation, or any other modification you think would benefit the project.\nStage and Commit Your Changes: Once you’ve made your changes, you stage them for commit using git add and then commit the changes with git commit.\nPush Your Changes to GitHub: The next step is to push your changes that exist on your local machine to your GitHub account. You can do this with git push.\nOpen a Pull Request: Finally, you return to the original repository on GitHub, and there should now be a message indicating that you recently pushed a new branch. You can click on “Compare & pull request” button to begin creating your pull request.\nWrite a Good Pull Request Description: It’s essential to write a clear and concise description of your pull request. You should explain what changes you’ve made, why you’ve made them, and how you’ve tested them if applicable. Good communication can streamline the review process and increase the chances of your pull request being accepted.\n\nOnce you’ve filed the pull request, owners of the repository will review your change. They may suggest modifications or even directly make changes. Once everyone is satisfied, they can merge your PR into the project, meaning your changes are now part of the main codebase!\nPull requests are a fantastic collaborative feature of Git and GitHub, enabling many developers all over the world to work together on both small and large projects."

    "text": "More Git Commands\nTwo important Git commands that can help you better understand and manage your project’s changes are git status and git diff.\n\nGit Status\ngit status shows you the status of changes as untracked, modified or staged. It’s a way to see what changes are queued for the next commit stage. When you run git status, Git will show you which branch you’re on, what changes exist in your working directory, and what changes have been staged.\nHere’s how to use it:\n\nNavigate to your git directory using cd in your terminal or command prompt.\nType git status and hit Enter.\n\nYou should now see a list of any modified or untracked files.\n\n\nGit Diff\ngit diff shows you the differences between your staged changes and your last commit. By using git diff, you can see line-by-line what has been added or removed from each file since the last commit.\nHere’s how to use it:\n\nNavigate to your git directory using cd in your terminal or command prompt.\nType git diff and hit Enter.\n\nNow, you’ll be able to see exactly what changes were made. Green lines represent additions to files, while red lines represent deletions.\nRemember, if you want to see the differences between your working directory and the staging area (the changes that haven’t been staged yet), simply use git diff without any files specified. However, if you want to see the differences in the staging area or between commits (the changes that have been staged), you should use git diff --staged.\n‘git status’ and ‘git diff’ are both essential commands for understanding your project’s changes and managing your staging area. Make sure to use these regularly to keep track of what’s going on in your repository.\n\n\nCreating a New Branch\nBranches allow you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously. To create a new branch:\ngit branch new-branch\nReplace ‘new-branch’ with your desired branch name.\n\n\nSwitching Between Branches\nTo switch from your current branch to another branch:\ngit checkout branch-name\nReplace ‘branch-name’ with the name of the branch you want to switch to.\n\n\nBasic Exercises\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1:\n\n\n\nClone the following GitHub repository, make a new branch, copy the expectations_template.txt file, rename it, make changes to a file, commit those changes, do another pull, and then push them to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2:\n\n\n\nOn your own GitHub test_demo repository (that you should have created in the configuration tutorial), add a new file, then add and commit that new file before pushing the changes to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3:\n\n\n\nFrom the cloned ch200-expectations repository, download the changes made by other students using git pull.\n\n\nIf you run into any issues, remember: your best friends are often the documentation, a quick web search (StackOverflow) or ChatGPT. The answers are almost always out there!"

They are called ‘pull requests’ because you’re asking the repository maintainer to ‘pull’ your changes.\nHere’s a basic flow of how to create a pull request on GitHub:\n\nFork the repository or create a new branch in the repository where you want to make changes.\nMake your changes in your branch. This could involve editing files, adding files, or removing files.\nPush these changes to your GitHub repository.\nGo to the main page of the GitHub repository where you want to propose changes.\nClick on the Pull request button.\nClick on the New pull request button.\nSelect your fork or branch on the right dropdown menu and the main repository or branch on the left.\nReview your changes and if everything looks good, click on the Create pull request button.\nAdd a title to your pull request and describe the changes you’ve made, then click Create pull request.\n\nOnce a pull request has been opened, the repository owner or collaborators can review the changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.\nThen, when all parties agree that the changes are ready, the owner or authorized collaborator can merge your changes into the original branch.\nRemember, properly communicating what changes you’ve made and why you made them in the pull request description is an integral part of effective collaboration."

Particularly popular among data scientists and machine learning engineers, Anaconda is equipped a multitude of tools for data science, scientific computing, and much more.\nWhy should you use Anaconda?\nOne of the main reasons is its package manager called Conda. With Conda, not only can you easily install packages, but you can also set up isolated environments to keep your projects organized and prevent potential conflicts between package versions.\nHere’s how to download Anaconda:\n\nNavigate to Anaconda’s download page.\nChoose your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\nSelect the Python 3.x version and click Download.\nRun the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.\n\nNow, let’s talk about virtual environments.\nVirtual environments are isolated environments where you can install packages and run code without affecting the rest of your system. These environments help you manage your project-specific dependencies separately, thus avoiding versioning conflicts and maintaining stability across all your projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nEach project should ideally have its own virtual environment.\n\n\n\nCreating your first Conda environment\nTo create a virtual environment using Conda, you can follow these steps:\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt.\nEnter conda create --name myenv python=3.10 replacing ‘myenv’ with the name you want to assign to your new environment. Note that we directly installed python (version 3.10).\nActivate your new environment by typing conda activate myenv (again, replace ‘myenv’ with the name of your environment).\nYou can now install packages either through conda install package_name or also using pip install package_name in the activated environment.\n\nNow, any packages that you install while this environment is activated will only affect this particular environment, leaving your global environment and any other virtual environments unchanged.\nBy using Anaconda and taking advantage of virtual environments, you can create a more organized, conflict-free coding setup, making your data science or programming projects significantly smoother and more manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Create course conda environment\n\n\n\n\nUse the commands above to create an environment with the name ch200 with python=3.10.\nActivate the created environment.\nAnd install the package jupyter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Create course conda environment\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the command line tool:\nconda create --name ch200 python=3.10\nconda activate ch200\nconda install jupyter"

    "text": "Introduction to IDEs and Text Editors\nAn important component of any programming or coding project is the tool used to write and edit your code. Two of the main options that we will be working with in this course are JupyterLab and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).\n\nJupyterLab\nJupyterLab is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Jupyter Notebooks, a project of the Project Jupyter open-source project. JupyterLab is web-based and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with Jupyter notebooks, code editors, data file viewers, terminals, and more, making it a great tool for data science projects.\n\n\nVisual Studio Code (VS Code)\nVisual Studio Code, often just called VS Code, is a popular free source-code editor developed by Microsoft. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, code refactoring, and more. Its features are highly extendable through plugins, and it supports a multitude of programming languages.\n\n\nDifferences between JupyterLab and VS Code\nWhile both JupyterLab and VS Code are powerful tools, there are key differences between the two:\n\nEnvironment: JupyterLab provides a web-based interface and is ideal for interactive and exploratory computing. On the other hand, VS Code is a comprehensive text editor and is more akin to a full-fledged integrated development environment.\nUse Case: JupyterLab excels when working with Jupyter notebooks and tasks that require visualizing data, running data analysis, and scientific computing in Python, Julia, R and other similar languages. VS Code shines when developing applications in various programming languages and it’s great for writing and managing codebases.\nFeatures: JupyterLab primarily offers an intuitive interface for running and editing Jupyter notebooks, viewing plots, and inspecting file variables. VS Code offers debugging tools, has Git commands built-in, can be customized and extended with plugins, and supports a multitude of programming languages.\n\nDepending on your project, you could find one tool to be more efficient than the other. JupyterLab’s interactive workflow could be beneficial for tasks such as data exploration and visualization, whereas VS Code might be more suited to application development. Ultimately, both are extremely useful and offer unique capabilities that could help improve your programming workflow."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Iterations and List Comprehensions in Python\nIterations play a crucial role in Python, allowing us to execute code repeatedly which can save a significant amount of time and effort. In Python, the most common forms of iteration are for and while loops. However, Python offers an even more concise and readable way to perform iterations, especially on lists — this is through list comprehensions. A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for statement, and possible if clauses. It provides a neat way to take an existing list, perform an operation on each element, and return the results in a new list. It is a very Pythonic way to generate or transform lists in a single line of code.\n\n\nIterations in Python\nIn Python, “iteration” means executing the same block of code over and over, potentially many times. Structures used for iteration are “loops”. Python provides two basic types of loop - for loop and while loop.\n\nFor Loop\nA for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). Each item in the sequence is assigned to the iteration variable, and the statement(s) are executed until the entire sequence is processed.\nHere is an example of a for loop that iterates over a list of elements:\nlist_of_elements = ['Hydrogen', 'Helium', 'Lithium', 'Beryllium']\n\nfor element in list_of_elements:\n    print(element)\nFor each iteration, the value of element will be updated to the next value in the list. So, the print() function will print each element from the list.\n\n\nWhile Loop\nA while loop repeatedly tests an expression (the loop condition), and keeps executing the loop body while the expression is True. Here is an example of a while loop:\ntemperature = 25\n\nwhile temperature &gt; 20:\n    print(\"The reaction is too fast!\")\n    temperature = temperature - 1\nThe loop will continue to print “The reaction is too fast!” and subtract 1 from the temperature, as long as the temperature is strictly greater than 20.\n\n\nLoop Control Statements\nLoop control statements change the execution of a loop from its normal sequence. Python provides the following loop control statements:\n\nbreak statement: Terminates the loop and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.\ncontinue statement: Causes the loop to skip the rest of its body for this iteration and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.\n\n\n\nExercises\n\nUsing a for loop, print the atomic number for each element in your list of five elements from the previous exercise.\nUsing a while loop, keep dividing a pressure of 100 atm by 2 until it is less than 1 atm, and print the current pressure at each step.\nIn the while loop above, add a break statement to exit the loop when the pressure is less than 5 atm.\nAlso in the while loop above, add a continue statement to skip the loop iteration when the pressure is exactly 10 atm and not print the pressure at this step.\n\n\n\nSolutions\nSolution 1:\nlist_of_elements = ['Hydrogen', 'Helium', 'Lithium', 'Beryllium']\nlist_of_atomic_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nfor i in range(len(list_of_elements)):\n    print(\"The atomic number of\", list_of_elements[i], \"is\", list_of_atomic_numbers[i])\nSolution 2:\npressure = 100\n\nwhile pressure &gt;= 1:\n    print(pressure)\n    pressure = pressure / 2\nSolution 3:\npressure = 100\n\nwhile pressure &gt;= 1:\n    if pressure &lt; 5:\n        break\n    print(pressure)\n    pressure = pressure / 2\nSolution 4:\npressure = 100\n\nwhile pressure &gt;= 1:\n    pressure = pressure / 2\n    if pressure == 10:\n        continue\n    print(pressure)\nBy controlling flow in Python, you can execute complex algorithms that can respond to varied conditions and perform intricate tasks at a high level.\n\n\n\nList Comprehensions in Python\nList comprehension is an elegant and concise way to create a new list from an existing list in Python.\nA list comprehension consists of an expression followed by a for statement inside square brackets.\nHere is an example to make a list with each item being increasing power of 2.\npowers_of_two = [2 ** x for x in range(10)]\nprint(powers_of_two) \nThis will output:\n[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]\nWe can also create more advanced list comprehensions which include a conditional statement on the iterable. Let’s square only the positive numbers in the following list.\nnumbers = [1, -2, 3, -4, -5, 6, -7]\nsquared = [n ** 2 for n in numbers if n &gt; 0]\nprint(squared)\nThis will output:\n[1, 9, 36]\nIn the context of Chemistry, let’s say we had a list of various elements and we wanted a new list which only included the elements with an atomic number less than 3.\nelements = [('Hydrogen', 1), ('Helium', 2), ('Lithium', 3), ('Beryllium', 4), ('Boron', 5)]\nlight_elements = [name for name, atomic_number in elements if atomic_number &lt; 3]\nprint(light_elements)\nThis will output:\n['Hydrogen', 'Helium']\n\nExercises\n\nTake a list of charges of ions and create a new list squared charges.\nCreate a list of atomic weights and make a new list consisting only those atomic weights which are greater than 2.\nUse list comprehension to create a list of molecules with atomic mass less than 10 from the given list.\n\n\n\nSolutions\nSolution 1:\ncharges = [-1, 2, -3, 2, 1, -2]\nsquared_charges = [charge ** 2 for charge in charges]\nprint(squared_charges)  #Output: [1, 4, 9, 4, 1, 4]\nSolution 2:\nweights = [1.0079, 4.0026, 6.94, 9.0122, 10.81]\nweights_gt_2 = [weight for weight in weights if weight &gt; 2]\nprint(weights_gt_2)  #Output: [4.0026, 6.94, 9.0122, 10.81]\nSolution 3:\nmolecules = [('Hydrogen', 1.0079), ('Helium', 4.0026), ('Lithium', 6.94), ('Beryllium', 9.0122), ('Boron', 10.81)]\nlight_molecules = [name for name, weight in molecules if weight &lt; 10]\nprint(light_molecules)  #Output: ['Hydrogen', 'Helium', 'Lithium']\nList comprehension is a powerful tool that makes your code more efficient and easier to read. It can be used whenever you need to transform or filter a list in Python."
