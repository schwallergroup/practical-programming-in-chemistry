This includes various utilities like compilers and—most crucial for this course—Git. Instead of installing it via the substantially large XCode software, we suggest a different method that won’t take up around 35 GB of your disk space.\nHere’s how to do it:\n\nOpen the Terminal application. It’s typically located in the /Applications/Utilities folder. Alternatively, press ⌘ and space bar simultaneously, type “terminal” in the search box, and select the Terminal application.\nOnce you see a prompt in the Terminal application, type xcode-select --install and hit Enter.\nFollow the instructions for installation when you’re prompted. Be aware it might take a few minutes to finish installing.\nClick here, skip the first step, and follow step 2 to 14.\n\nBy the end you should have created your first repository.\n\n\nFor Windows Users: Installing Git and Chrome or Firefox\nWe’ll be utilizing JupyterLab and/or VS Code in this tutorial. As JupyterLab is a browser-based application, it’s compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. However, Microsoft Edge isn’t supported. So, if you’re a Windows user, make sure you have either Chrome or Firefox installed.\nYou’ll also need to install Git. Here are the instructions to do so:\n\nClick here and follow the instructions provided.\n\nBy the end you should have created your first repository."

This guide will take you through the process of creating such a folder in your home directory. We recommend this setup as it’s simple, clean, and conveniently located in a familiar place.\n\nFor macOS/Linux Users\n\nOpen the Terminal application:\n\nFor macOS users, open Spotlight Search by pressing ⌘ and space bar simultaneously, then type “Terminal” and hit Enter.\nFor Linux users, you can use the search feature in your distribution’s application menu and type “Terminal”, or you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt+ T.\n\nOnce you’ve opened the Terminal, you should be automatically within your home directory. If not, type cd ~ to navigate to your home directory.\nNow, create the ‘git’ folder by typing mkdir git and hit Enter. This creates a new folder named ‘git’ in your home directory.\n\n\n\nFor Windows Users\n\nTo open Command Prompt, press the Windows key and type “Command Prompt”, and hit Enter.\nOnce in Command Prompt, navigate to your home directory by typing cd %HOMEPATH% and hitting Enter.\nNow, create the ‘git’ folder by typing mkdir git and hitting Enter. This creates a new folder named ‘git’ within your home directory.\n\nNow you have a dedicated ‘git’ folder in your home directory where you can clone, create and manage your repositories. This organization can help streamline your workflow and make working with Git a more enjoyable experience!"

    "text": "Introduction to Anaconda and Virtual Environments\nAnaconda is an open-source distribution that simplifies package management and deployment for both Python and R. Particularly popular among data scientists and machine learning engineers, Anaconda is equipped a multitude of tools for data science, scientific computing, and much more.\nWhy should you use Anaconda?\nOne of the main reasons is its package manager called Conda. With Conda, not only can you easily install packages, but you can also set up isolated environments to keep your projects organized and prevent potential conflicts between package versions.\nHere’s how to download Anaconda:\n\nNavigate to Anaconda’s download page.\nChoose your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\nSelect the Python 3.x version and click Download.\nRun the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.\n\nNow, let’s talk about virtual environments.\nVirtual environments are isolated environments where you can install packages and run code without affecting the rest of your system. These environments help you manage your project-specific dependencies separately, thus avoiding versioning conflicts and maintaining stability across all your projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nEach project should ideally have its own virtual environment.\n\n\n\nCreating your first Conda environment\nTo create a virtual environment using Conda, you can follow these steps:\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt.\nEnter conda create --name myenv python=3.10 replacing ‘myenv’ with the name you want to assign to your new environment. Note that we directly installed python (version 3.10).\nActivate your new environment by typing conda activate myenv (again, replace ‘myenv’ with the name of your environment).\nYou can now install packages either through conda install package_name or also using pip install package_name in the activated environment.\n\nNow, any packages that you install while this environment is activated will only affect this particular environment, leaving your global environment and any other virtual environments unchanged.\nBy using Anaconda and taking advantage of virtual environments, you can create a more organized, conflict-free coding setup, making your data science or programming projects significantly smoother and more manageable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: Create course conda environment\n\n\n\n\nUse the commands above to create an environment with the name ch200 with python=3.10.\nActivate the created environment.\nAnd install the package jupyter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution: Create course conda environment\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the command line tool:\nconda create --name ch200 python=3.10\nconda activate ch200\nconda install jupyter"
